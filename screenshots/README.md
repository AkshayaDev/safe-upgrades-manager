## WordPress.org Display

Screenshots will appear in the order they are numbered (1, 2, 3, 4) on your plugin's WordPress.org page. The first screenshot is especially important as it's the primary image users see.

## Taking Screenshots

1. Activate the plugin on a test WordPress installation
2. Create some sample backups by uploading themes/plugins
3. Navigate to Tools > Upgrade Backups
4. Take screenshots of the interface
5. Capture the upgrade process in action
6. Ensure all screenshots show a clean, professional WordPress admin interface

Remember to remove any sensitive information (domain names, personal data) from screenshots before uploading to WordPress.org.
